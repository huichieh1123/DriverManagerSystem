# Project Progress Record: DriverManagerSystem

## Date: 2025年8月10日 星期日

## Implemented Features:

*   **Backend:**
    *   Added `get_drivers_by_company_id` method to `CRUDUserMongoDB` (in `backend/app/crud/__init__.py`).
    *   Implemented `get_drivers_by_company_id_mongodb` function (in `backend/app/db/mongodb.py`) to query for users with the "driver" role based on `company_id`.
    *   Refactored invitation sending logic to correctly pass `invitee_id`, `invitee_username`, and `invitee_role` to the `create_invitation_mongodb` function.

## Development Steps Taken:

1.  **Initial Project Exploration:**
    *   Listed directory contents of `C:\Users\ajhui\桌面\projects\DriverManagerSystem`.
    *   Identified `backend` (Python FastAPI) and `frontend` (Vue 3, Vite) components.
    *   Analyzed `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, and `render.yaml` for technology stack and deployment configuration.

2.  **Addressing `AttributeError: 'CRUDUserMongoDB' object has no attribute 'get_drivers_by_company_id'`:**
    *   Located `CRUDUserMongoDB` in `backend/app/crud/__init__.py`.
    *   Located `get_dispatchers_by_company_id_mongodb` in `backend/app/db/mongodb.py` as a template.
    *   **Action:** Added `get_drivers_by_company_id_mongodb` to `backend/app/db/mongodb.py`.
    *   **Action:** Added `get_drivers_by_company_id` to `CRUDUserMongoDB` in `backend/app/crud/__init__.py`.
    *   Confirmed fix in `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/companies.py`.

3.  **Addressing Invitation Sending Errors (Iterative Debugging):**

    *   **Error 1: `create_invitation_mongodb() missing 2 required positional arguments: 'company_id' and 'company_name'`**
        *   **Investigation:** `invitation.create` in `companies.py` was passing `invitation_in` as the first argument, but `create_invitation_mongodb` expected separate `invitee_id`, `invitee_username`, `invitee_role`.
        *   **Action:** Modified `backend/app/crud/__init__.py` to unpack `invitation_data` into `invitee_id`, `invitee_username`, `invitee_role` before passing to `mongodb.create_invitation_mongodb`.

    *   **Error 2: `'InvitationCreate' object has no attribute 'invitee_id'`**
        *   **Investigation:** `InvitationCreate` schema in `backend/app/api/v1/schemas/invitations.py` did not include `invitee_id`.
        *   **Action (Incorrect Attempt):** Tried to create a new `InvitationCreate` object with `invitee_id` in `companies.py`, which failed due to schema mismatch.
        *   **Action (Correction):** Reverted the incorrect attempt in `companies.py`.

    *   **Error 3: `CRUDInvitationMongoDB.create() got an unexpected keyword argument 'invitee_id'`**
        *   **Investigation:** `companies.py` was passing `invitee_id` as a keyword argument, but `CRUDInvitationMongoDB.create` was not expecting it in its signature.
        *   **Action:** Modified `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/companies.py` to pass `invitee_username`, `invitee_role`, `invitee_id`, `company_id`, `company_name` as separate arguments to `invitation.create`.
        *   **Action:** Modified `backend/app/crud/__init__.py` to change `CRUDInvitationMongoDB.create` signature to accept these arguments directly.

    *   **Error 4: `NameError: name 'RoleType' is not defined`**
        *   **Investigation:** `RoleType` was used in `backend/app/crud/__init__.py` but not imported.
        *   **Action:** Added `from app.api.v1.schemas.users import RoleType` to `backend/app/crud/__init__.py`.

## Resolved Issues (as of 2025年8月10日 星期日):

The following issues have been addressed and fixed:

*   **Backend: `AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'invitee_username'`**
    *   **Cause:** The return value from `invitation.create` was a dictionary, but it was being accessed like an object (`new_invitation.invitee_username`) in `endpoints/companies.py`.
    *   **Fix:** Corrected the code to use dictionary key access (`new_invitation['invitee_username']`).

*   **Frontend: `Identifier 'handleCreateJob' has already been declared`**
    *   **Cause:** The `handleCreateJob` function was declared twice in `views/DispatcherPage.vue`.
    *   **Fix:** Removed the duplicate function declaration.

*   **Frontend: Edit form not closing on update failure**
    *   **Cause:** In `views/DispatcherPage.vue`, the `handleUpdateJob` function did not clear the `editingJob` state if the API call failed, leaving the edit form stuck open.
    *   **Fix:** Refactored the function to use a `finally` block, ensuring `editingJob.value = null` is always executed. Also added an alert to notify the user of the update failure.

*   **Backend: `AttributeError: 'CRUDInvitationMongoDB' object has no attribute 'get_for_invitee'`**
    *   **Cause:** An API endpoint in `endpoints/dispatchers.py` was calling `invitation.get_for_invitee`, but this method was not defined in the `CRUDInvitationMongoDB` class in `crud/__init__.py`. This was due to an incomplete refactoring.
    *   **Fix:** Implemented the `get_for_invitee` method in the `CRUDInvitationMongoDB` class, connecting it to the corresponding database function and removing the obsolete `get_for_dispatcher` method.

All outstanding issues from the previous session are now believed to be resolved.

## Progress Update (as of 2025年8月10日 星期日):

### Features Implemented:

*   **Dispatcher Claim Public Job:**
    *   Implemented a new backend endpoint (`POST /jobs/{job_id}/dispatcher_claim`) allowing dispatchers to claim public jobs and assign them to company drivers with specific vehicles.
    *   Developed the corresponding frontend UI in `DispatcherPage.vue`, including a modal for driver and vehicle selection.
*   **Delete All My Created Jobs:**
    *   Added a frontend button in `DispatcherPage.vue` that enables dispatchers to batch delete all jobs they have created.

### Bug Fixes & Improvements:

*   **Invitation & Association Logic Refinement:**
    *   Ensured role-specific company association and disassociation. Users are now accurately listed as drivers or dispatchers based on their accepted invitation role, preventing unintended cross-role listings.
*   **Vehicle Data Consistency Across Jobs:**
    *   Standardized vehicle data storage: `vehicle_model` now consistently stores "Make" (廠牌) and `vehicle_type` stores "Model" (車型) throughout the job creation, application, and claiming processes.
    *   Updated Excel import/export functionalities for jobs to correctly reflect the "vehicle_make" header and map it to the appropriate field.
    *   Corrected frontend labels for vehicle fields in job forms and details to display "廠牌 (Make)" and "車型 (Model)".
*   **Driver Page Job Details Display:**
    *   Resolved an issue where job details were not viewable for "Jobs Pending Your Acceptance" on the driver dashboard.
*   **Dispatcher Claim Process Robustness:**
    *   Fixed a 422 "Unprocessable content" error during dispatcher job claiming by ensuring the username is correctly passed as a query parameter for authentication.
    *   Addressed an `AttributeError` by ensuring dictionary key access for driver details during job claiming.
    *   Ensured the vehicle "Make" is correctly transferred to the final assigned job details after a dispatcher claims a job.

All recent development tasks and reported issues have been addressed.
